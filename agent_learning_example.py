REAL-TIME AGENT LEARNING PROCESS
================================

Jab agent customer se call karta hai, ye sab kuch automatically hota hai:
"""

# 1. CALL START HONE PAR
"""
POST /agents/ai/start-call/
{
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "call_type": "outbound",
    "context": "Product inquiry follow-up"
}

Response:
{
    "call_id": "call_123",
    "customer_profile": {...},
    "agent_persona_activated": true
}
"""

# 2. REAL-TIME LEARNING DURING CALL
"""
Har customer response par agent sikhta hai:

Customer: "I'm not interested"
Agent: "I understand, but what if I could save you $200 monthly?"
Customer: "Tell me more..." (sentiment improved)

Automatically ye API call hoti hai:
"""

POST_DATA_OBJECTION = {
    "call_id": "call_123",
    "learning_event": "customer_objection",
    "objection_text": "I'm not interested",
    "agent_response": "I understand, but what if I could save you $200 monthly?",
    "effectiveness_score": 8,  # Customer showed interest after response
    "customer_reaction": "positive"
}

# Real-time sentiment learning
POST_DATA_SENTIMENT = {

# 3. CALL END PAR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
"""
Call khatam hone par full analysis:

    "conversation_id": "conv_456",
    "full_transcript": "Agent: Hello... Customer: Hi... [full conversation]",

Ye analysis karti hai:
- Conversation flow analysis
- Objection handling effectiveness
- Customer sentiment journey
- Successful techniques identification
- Areas for improvement
- Personalized recommendations

Agent ke memory mein ye sab automatically save hota hai:
