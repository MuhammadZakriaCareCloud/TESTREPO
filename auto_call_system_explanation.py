AUTO CALL SYSTEM SETUP
======================

Webhook URLs sirf incoming events handle karte hain.
Automatic calls start karne ke liye ye components chahiye:
"""

# CURRENT WEBHOOK STATUS:
"""
✅ Webhooks = Incoming events handle karte hain
❌ Webhooks ≠ Automatic call start nahi karte

Webhooks ka kaam:
- Call already chal rahi hai → Events receive karna
- Learning data save karna
- Agent memory update karna

Auto calls ka kaam:
- Calls khud se start karna
- Customer lists process karna  
- Scheduled calls manage karna
"""

# SOLUTION: COMPLETE AUTO CALL SYSTEM
"""
3 components chahiye automatic calls ke liye:
"""

# 1. CALL SCHEDULER COMPONENT
AUTO_CALL_SCHEDULER = {
    "function": "Schedule calls automatically",
    "triggers": [
        "Time-based (every hour, daily, etc.)",
        "Event-based (new customer added)",
        "Manual trigger (start campaign)",
        "Callback reminders"
    ],
    "implementation": "Django management command + Celery"
}

# 2. CUSTOMER LIST PROCESSOR  
CUSTOMER_LIST_PROCESSOR = {
    "function": "Process customer lists for calling",
    "features": [
        "Import CSV/Excel customer lists",
        "Filter customers by criteria",
        "Prioritize hot leads first", 
        "Skip do-not-call numbers",
        "Manage call attempts"
    ],
    "implementation": "Django models + bulk operations"
}

# 3. TWILIO CALL INITIATOR
TWILIO_CALL_INITIATOR = {
    "function": "Actually make the calls",
    "process": [
        "Get next customer from queue",
        "Check agent availability", 
        "Initiate Twilio call",
        "Connect to HumeAI",
        "Track call progress"
    ],
    "implementation": "Twilio API + HumeAI integration"
}

"""
COMPLETE AUTO CALL FLOW:
========================

1. SETUP PHASE:
   ✅ Upload customer list
   ✅ Configure agent settings
   ✅ Set call schedule/rules
   ✅ Configure webhooks (for learning)

2. AUTO CALL EXECUTION:
   🤖 Scheduler triggers call campaign
   📞 System picks next customer
   📱 Twilio initiates call
   🎯 HumeAI handles conversation
   📊 Webhooks save learning data
   ⏰ Schedule follow-ups if needed

3. MONITORING:
   📈 Track call progress
   📋 Monitor agent performance  
   🔄 Adjust strategy based on results
"""

# IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES:
IMPLEMENTATION_COMPONENTS = {
    # Django management command for auto calls
    "management_command": "python manage.py start_auto_calls --campaign=real_estate",
    
    # Celery task for scheduled calls
    "celery_task": "@periodic_task(run_every=crontab(minute=0, hour='9-17'))",
    
    # REST API for manual triggers
    "api_endpoint": "POST /agents/campaigns/start-auto-calls/",
    
    # Dashboard for monitoring
    "dashboard": "/dashboard/auto-calls/monitor/"
}

print("Webhooks = Incoming events handle karte hain")
print("Auto Calls = Separate system chahiye")
print("Complete solution: Scheduler + Processor + Initiator + Webhooks")
